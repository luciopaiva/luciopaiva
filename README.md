I'm Lucio Paiva, a software engineer living in Lisbon. Welcome to my collection of open source projects. You may be interested in [Heapify](https://github.com/luciopaiva/heapify), a fast Javascript priority queue implementation. [Witchcraft](https://github.com/luciopaiva/witchcraft), a cool Chrome extension to load custom JS/CSS files to any web page may also be of use. I publish here almost everything that I write, so browse around and you may find something else interesting.

Also go ahead and check all the other stuff I've been doing: https://luciopaiva.com.
